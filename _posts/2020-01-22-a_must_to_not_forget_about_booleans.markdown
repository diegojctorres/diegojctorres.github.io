A must about booleans to not forget about is to actually use them when you are working with a code that could benefit from it to be able to provide more focused and productive results. Just as in important is that they come in hand when we are trying to implement control flow. Wondering what control flow is? Yeah I was too. Control flow is what occurs when we tell our program to execute certain lines of code based on specific conditions. In case that's confusing you, take for example as basic as "IF I am hungry THEN I'll eat an apple, otherwise I'll wait until dinner" or IF its is TRUE then I'll eat the apple, IF it's false I'll wait". Understanding that concept we can then slide into Booleane Operators which are methods that have return values. 

So yes, as we move along learnig new information so rapidly on a daily basis a very important golden rule is not kaing this harder than it is not or overthinking it. When you break it down to act and reaction, or describing a cause and effect, step by step, new tools like booleans are in essence the next step on how to write crisp, clean, and most importantly, functioning code.
