#People ask you, maybe less now than before, why YOU want to learn coding and be a software engineering or why do you want to get into software engineering. So 99.9% it is not from a "wow" perspective, "that's so cool!"; it's usually with a confused stare like you announcing you're moving to Antartica, a "why would  you do that to yourself?". They think it's difficult, which it is. They think it's boring, which it is not. They think it's a life of staring at a computer screening with giant headphones, a hoodie, and bunch of junk food litered across your desk, it is for some and not for others, but not in a bad way. The last part has a point, and that it is different for every workplace and type of industry you're working in. 

I have the pleasure of working at an SaaS for HR company that is very forward with their work culture where the guy or girl with giant headphones and car driver chair is the norm versus other offices where it might be different, and that's all it, just different, not bad. Why? Because of the culture that company has, and that's one of the reasons why I joined software engineering. That I could be in a career that allowed me the flexibility of what company culture I wanted to be a part of. As well as the flexibility to be creative and have a choice on what team setting I liked. I see the software engineers at my office and they interact with each other, they collaborate, they analyze and critique no different than the marketing team, just as creative even.

I could mention the obvious points of working in the tech industry as reasons as well like pay, trend, sustainability, but I've come to learn that liking what you do is very important, top three reasons why you'd give away 8 or more hours of your day for years to come.
